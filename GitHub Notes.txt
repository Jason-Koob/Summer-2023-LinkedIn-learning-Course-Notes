-- Overview

    These are my notes about the basics of GitHub, This involves, how to navigate the site, how to use the many programs and applications that GitHub has to offer, and how GitHub is a tool that can be beneficial.

-- GitHub 

    GitHub is "an online service where developers can work together" using cloud storage to share with others.

-- Other forms of GitHub

    Git - A command-line form of managing repositories and files on GitHub.

    GitHub Desktop - A desktop application for managing all things GitHub in a desktop application.

-- Services GitHub Offers

    GitHub Copilot - GitHub partnered with OpenAI's Codex to produce an Artificially Intelligent tool to help write code with you, while you write the code. 
    This tool requires a subscription but it works in multiple popular code editor software such as Visual Studio Code.

    GitHub Codespaces - GitHub hosts a virtual machine in which a copy of a repository is made. You can access this virtual machine with a subscription.

-- Repositories

    Repository - A repository is a group of files that can be stored locally or on the GitHub cloud, the files can be changed and sent to the cloud for others to view.

    Branch - A branch is a sub-section of a repository, it can be used to implement features or make changes without changing the main branch.

-- Functions

    function - Functions can happen to a repository to change what is inside of it.

        Clone - This function can be done on multiple desktop and CLI interfaces for GitHub/Git. This function asks GitHub to make a copy of a repository on the local machine.

        Commit - Once changes are made to a file in a repository, the changes can be uploaded to the GitHub cloud, to do this, there needs to be a summary and description attached to the changes.

        Push - A push is a way to make changes to a repository. If you do not have access to commit to the repository, these changes are reviewed by someone who can merge these changes into a branch.

        Pull - Pulling changes from a push request, and accepting them into a branch.

        Merge - This is the final form of verification between branches and a proposed push request.

-- Project - A project is a management view of issues and pull requests.
