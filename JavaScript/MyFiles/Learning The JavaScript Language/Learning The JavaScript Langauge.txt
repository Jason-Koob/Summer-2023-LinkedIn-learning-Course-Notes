        Strings

            Quotation marks can be used in strings with a backslash before them
                "This is a quote \"Quote\" I am using as an example."

    Objects, Arrays, and More

        Objects

        Using Objects For Data Modeling

        Manipulating Objects

            Values of properties inside an object can be changed
                object.['property'] = value

            These properties can also be removed with:
                delete object. property

        Jargon: References

            value1 = value2
                This causes any changes made to one of these values to be made to the other as well

            Copies can be made safely with this:
                value2 = { ...value1 };

        Arrays

        Manipulating Arrays

            Adding items to the end of an array can be done using:
            
                array[array.length] = "new item"
                
                OR 

                array.push("new item")

        Terse If: Ternaries

        Type Checking

            'type of' [variable] returns the variable type

    Iterating With Loops

        For Loops: Sequential

            for (var = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                function body
            }

        For Loops: Enumerative

            for (var x in [array/object]) {
                function body
            }

        Set and Map: Newer Loopable Data Types

            Sets are like arrays but can only store each value only once

        Jargon: Scope In JavaScript

        Functions In Scope

            global.[value] uses the global value instead of an internal value

            window.[value] is global for HTML elements
