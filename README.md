## Description: A conglomerate of notes from LinkedIn Learning courses during my summer 2023 semester

# Overview
I will complete a series of course on LinkedIn Learning. I will document my notes to this repository. This is the order in which I will take the courses. I invite you to take them too as they are beneficial to everyone.

  Firstly, I need to learn more about GitHub, this is a good course to start with and learn some of the basics:
