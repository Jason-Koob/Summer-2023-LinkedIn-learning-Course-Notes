        -- Answer every question
        -- Go between questions
        -- Make at least three passes through the exams
            1st pass - Answer the easier questions, skipping challenging or performance-based questions
            2nd pass - Try to answer every question
            3rd pass - clean up any errors that you've made

    -- Scoring

        Scores will be ranged from 100 to 950, anything above 750 will pass.
