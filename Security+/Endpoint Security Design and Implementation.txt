Endpoint Security Design and Implementation

    Introduction

        Endpoint Security

            Endpoints are attractive targets because they can allow attackers a way into a larger network

    Host Security

        Operating System Security

            Limit administrative access to systems

            Patch Management
                - Corrects security issues

            System Hardening
                - Remove unnecessary software and operating system components
                - Lock down the host firewall configuration
                - Disable default accounts and passwords
                - Confirm Windows Registry and Linux configuration settings match best practices

        Malware Prevention

            Virus - Malicious code objects that spread from system to system via human interaction
            Worm - Malicious code objects that spread from system to system without the need for human interaction
            Trojan Horse - A piece of malicious code that is attached to a legitimate software package
            Spyware - Malicious code that gathers information often without the user knowing

            Malware prevention technology
                - Signature Detection - Watches for known patterns of malware activity
                - Behavior Detection - Watches for deviations from normal patterns of activity

            Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) - Deep analysis of RAM usage, network connections, and other behaviors
            
            Sandboxing - Sending malicious code to a separate system to watch for what it does

            Spam Filtering - Blocks unwanted emails

        Application Management

            - restricts software that may run

                Whitelist - A list of all allowed applications on a system
                Blacklist - A list of all applications that are prohibited

                Send all application control logs to SIEM for further analysis

                Host Software Baselining - A standard pattern for applications and system resources

        Host-based Network Security Controls

            Firewall - Restrict network traffic

                Default Deny Rule - Any connecting which is not explicitly allowed, is denied

                Network Firewall - A hardware device that stands between two networks to regulate connections

                Host Firewall - A software firewall that regulates connections to and from a particular system

                *EXAM TIP* - Granting network access requires configuring both network and host firewalls

                Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) - Incorporates advanced security features, such as contextual information about the user and application

                Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - A system that alerts administrators to suspicious network activity

                Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - A system that actively prevents intrusions into host systems

        File Integrity Monitoring

            - Watches for unexpected file modifications
                - This is done using hash functions
            - An important part of the Defense-in-Depth approach

            *EXAM TIP* - Analyzing the outputs of a file integrity monitoring system would make a good exam question

            A software that allows for file integrity monitoring is called Tripwire.

        Data Loss Prevention

            Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
                - technology solutions that search systems and monitor networks for sensitive and unsecured information and provide the ability to remove the information, block the transmission, or encrypt the stored data

                Host-Based DLP
                    - Uses software agents installed on a single system

                Network-Based DLP
                    - Uses software installed on firewall and network devices to monitor network traffic

                Cloud-Based DLP
                    - Operate as managed security services provided by a cloud provider

                Pattern Matching
                    - Searching for known patterns of sensitive information such as XXXX-XX-XXXX

                Watermarking
                    - Imprinting sensitive information with tags

            A Host-Based Data Loss Prevention system is called Spirion.

                    1. Read the boot loader from the disk
                    2. Compute the hash value of the boot loader
                    3. Decrypt the boot loader's digital signature
                    4. Verify the signature is accurate to the provided public key

                    Remote Attestation - The sending of aforementioned  hash values to an external server for future use

                Measured Boot

                    - Description of the change
                    - Expected impact
                    - Risk Assessment
                    - Rollback plan

                - A standard to assign numbers to each change to a specific number

        Physical Asset Management

            Asset management should follow a lifecycle approach

                1. user creates a request for a piece of hardware
                2. Inventory is updated to show the piece of hardware
                3. The device is configured and managed by an IT staff member and delivered to a person who requested it
                4. Upon receiving a new device, the old device is de-provisioned and properly disposed of
