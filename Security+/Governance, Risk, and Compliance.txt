Governance, Risk, and Compliance

    Risk Analysis

        Risk Assessment

            Risk Assessment
                - identify and prioritize risks based on how likely they are to happen and how impactful they are

            Threat
                - Some external force
            
                Threat vector
                    - The methods used to exploit a vulnerability

            Vulnerability
                - Weakness in security controls

            Risks occur when an environment has both a threat and a vulnerability

            Qualitative risk assessment
                - Uses subjective ratings to evaluate risk the likelihood and impact

            Quantitative risk assessment
                - Use objective numeric ratings to evaluate the likelihood and impact

        Quantitative Risk Assessment

            Perform Quantitative risk assessment for a single risk and asset pair at a time

            Value evaluation factors:
                - Asset value (AV)
                    - Original value
                    - Depreciated value
                    - Replacement value
                - Exposure factor (EF)
                    - Expected percentage of damage to an asset
                Single-Loss expectancy (SLE)
                    - Expected dollar loss if a risk occurs one time
                    - AV * EF = SLE
                        - 20 * 50% = 10

            Likelihood factors:
                - Annual rate of occurrence (ARO)
                    - Number of times each year a risk is expected to occur
                - Annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
                    - Expected dollar loss from a risk given any year
                        - SLE * ARO = ALE
                            - 10 * 0.01 = .1
            
            Time factors:
                - Mean time to failure (MTTF)
                    - Average time a non-repairable component will last
                - Mean time between failure (MTBF)
                    - Average time a repairable component will last
                - Mean time to repair (MTTR)
                    - Average time a repair will need while being repaired

        Risk Types

            Internal risks:
                - Any risk that may arise from inside an organization

            External risks:

            Multiparty risks:
                - Risks that are shared across many organizations

            Legacy risks:
                - Unsupported systems

        Information Classification

            Data classification policies:
                - Assign information to categories, known as classifications, that determine storage, handling, and access requirements

                    Classifications are based on:
                        - Sensitivity
                            - Personally identifiable information (PII)
                            - Financial information

                        - Criticality

    Risk Management

        Risk Treatment Options

            Risk management/treatment
                - This is a process of systematically analyzing potential responses to each risk and implementing strategies to control those risks appropriately

                Options:
                    - Avoidance
                        - Changing the organization's business practices to divert the risk
                            - Example - Moving storage to the midwest to avoid the risk of a flood
                    - Transference
                        - Shifts the impact of the risk to another organization
                            - Example - Cloud storage insurance
                    - Mitigation
                        - Taking actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk
                            - Example - flood control water-ducts
                    - Acceptance
                        - Accepting the risk without taking further action
                            - Example - The cost of another option out-weights the benefits

                    - Risk profile
                        - The full set of risks facing an organization

                Inherent risk
                    - The original risk being dealt with
                Residual risk
                    - The original risk has been reduced
                Control risk
                    - The risk of the applied control failing
        
        Categorizing Security Controls

            Purpose of security controls:
                - Preventive - The goal is to stop security issues in the first place
                - Detective - Identify unwanted security breaches in the control (IDS)
                - Corrective - Remediate security issues that have occurred
                - Deterrent - Prevent an attacker from seeking to violate security policies
                - Physical - Impacts the physical world
                - Compensating - Fill a known gap in a security environment

            Mechanism of actions:
                - Technical - Use technology to achieve security control objectives
                - Operational - The processes up in place to manage technology in a secure manner
                    - These mechanisms of action are carried out by individuals, not technology
                - Managerial - Improve the security of the risks management process itself
