Physical Security Design and Implementation

    Introduction

        Physical Security
            - Physically protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data

        What you need to know

    Data Center Protection

        Site and Facility Design

            Data Centers - Facilities that contain massive quantities of valuable information and computing resources

            Server rooms - Contain sensitive information in less secure locations

            Media Storage Facilities - Require additional attention, particularly if in a remote location

            Evidence Storage - Storing evidence to later be used for investigation, used in the chain of custody

            Wiring Closets - Closets with wiring connecting devices, potentially allowing eavesdroppers and network intrusion

        Data Center Environmental Controls

            Data centers need adequate air conditioning
                - Expanded Environmental Envelope - Temperatures between 64.4 and 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit

            Humidity
                - Too high - Condensation forms leaving water droplets near the equipment
                - Too low - Static electricity can damage electronics
                    - Dew Point Range - Between 41.9 and 50.0 degrees Fahrenheit

            Data Rack Design
                - Intake cool air through the front, and output hot air through the back
                - This can allow data center designers to face data racks towards each other, creating hot isles, and cold isles

        Data Center Environmental Protection

            How fires start:
                Oxygen
                Heat
                Fuel
            
            A common approach to stop a fire is water, this can damage or destroy computer systems, so it should not be used in data centers
                - Instead, use a class C fire extinguisher, these fire extinguishers are designed to stop electrical fires

                Class A - Common combustibles (wood, cloth, and trash)
                Class B - Flammable liquids (gasoline and oil)
                Class C - Electrical fires (data centers)
                Class D - Heavy metal fires (industrial applications)
                Class E - Kitchen fires (fats and oils)

            *EXAM TIP* - Know where each class of fire extinguisher is used and each intended purpose

                Each fire extinguisher has a label telling what it is used for

            Pipes:
                Wet pipe approach - Water is always in the pipes, potentially causing a burst
                Dry pipe approach - The pipes are dry but can fill with water when needed

            Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

                - EMI is generated by all electronic equipment
                    - Interferes with the normal operation of other equipment
                    - Enables eavesdropping attacks

        Physical Access Controls

            Locks - preventive measures to restrict entry through portals
                Preset - Physical locks using physical, often metal keys that never change
                Cipher - Requires a correct PIN or information through an electronic input to gain Access
                Biometric - Scanning for a physical characteristic to permit access
                Card - require a card to be scanned and validated to gain entry

            Tail-gating - An authorized user holding the door open for an unauthorized individual
            
            Man Trap - A series of doors that provides a space between a public area and a secure area

            Monitoring
                - Motion Detection - Detecting abnormal motion
                - Noise Detection - Detecting abnormal noise
                - Video Surveillance - Gaurding and recording with the use of a camera and recording

        Visitor Management

            - Describe allowable visit purposes

            - Explain visiting approval authority

            - Describe requirements for unescorted access

            - Explain the role of visitor escorts

        Physical Security Personnel

            Two-person Integrity - Two people must enter sensitive areas together

            Two-person Control - Two people must jointly approve sensitive actions

    Hardware and Data Security

        Data Lifecycle

            Create - New data is created/modified in either an on-premises system or a cloud system

            Store - Data is placed in a storage system

            Use - Data is viewed and processed

            Share - Data is made available to others

            Archive - Data is put away in cold, long-term storage

            Destroy - Data is securely destroyed

                Data must be securely destroyed to prevent reconstruction
                    Clearing - Overwrites sensitive information to frustrate casual analysis
                    Purging/Wiping - Using more advanced techniques to frustrate laboratory analysis
                        - This includes degaussing (strong magnetic fields)
                    Destroying - Completely obliterates the media through shredding, pulverization, melting, or burning

        Hardware Physical Security

            Encryption

            USB Data Blockers - preventing USB devices from mounting to systems

            Laptop Lock - Connecting a physical lock to the laptop and a strong fixture

            *EXAM TIP* Connect laptop locks to secure fixtures or furniture

            Personally Identifiable Tag - Recorded tags on devices or systems which can be used to identify a device or instruct how to return the device

    Business Continuity

        Business Continuity Planning

            Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
                - The set of controls designed to keep a business running in the face of adversity, whether natural or man-made

                *EXAM TIP* - BCP is also known as Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP)

                Defining The Continuity Scope:
                    - What business activities will the plan cover?
                    - What system will it cover?
                    - What controls will it consider?

            Business Impact Assessment (BIA)
                - Identifies and prioritizes risks

                EXAMPLE - Hurricane - USD 145,000

                *EXAM TIP* - Business continuity in the cloud is a plan between the providers and the consumer

        Business Continuity Controls

            Redundancy - protects against the failure of a single component

            Single Point of Failure Analysis (SPOF)
                - Identifies and removes SPOFs

                Single points of failure should be removed until the costs outweigh the benefits

        High Availability and Fault Tolerance

            High Availability - Using multiple systems to protect against service failure

            Fault Tolerance - Making a single system resilient against technical failures

            Load Balancing - Spreading demand across systems to reduce stress on systems

            Most common points of failure:
                - Power supply (contain moving parts)
                - Storage (Corrupting disks)
                    Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)

                        RAID 1 - Data is mirrored across two disks, effectively copying one disk to another as a redundant backup

                        RAID 5 - Data is striped in parity to a third disk, along with data being mirrored to a secondary disk

                        *EXAM TIP* - RAID is a fault-tolerance technique, not a backup strategy

                - Network (connections severed, or disrupted)

    Disaster Recovery

        Disaster Recovery
        
            Disaster Recovery - Capabilities designed to restore a business to normal operations as quickly as possible. Disaster recovery is a subset of business continuity

                Environmental Disaster - Hurricane

                Man-Made Disaster - Ransomware

                Sources may be internal or external

            Initial Response:
                - Contain the damage caused by the Disaster
                - Recover whatever capabilities may be immediately restored

                - Include a variety of activities depending on the nature of the disaster

                After the initial response, the team shifts to assessment mode to assess the damage

            Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
                - The maximum amount of time that it should take to recover a service after a disaster
            
            Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
                - Maximum amount of time from which data may be lost in the wake of a disaster

            Recovery Service Level (RSL)
                - The percentage of a service that must be available during a disaster

        Backups

            The loss of critical business data can have catastrophic effects

            Backup - Provide organizations with a data safety net

                Full Backup - Include a complete copy of all data

                Differential Backup - Include all data modified since the last backup

                Incremental Backup - Include all data modified since that last full or incremental backup

        Restoring Backups

            Non-persistence - Only storing data that is unique
                EXAMPLE - backups of only the file directories that are important and not whole operating systems

        Disaster Recovery Sites

            Disaster Recovery Site - Provide alternative data processing while a disaster is being handled elsewhere

                Hot Site - Fully operational data centers, stocked with equipment and data, and are available at a moment's notice

                Warm Site - Stocked with all necessary equipment and data, not maintained in a parallel fashion to hot sites

                Cold Site - Empty data centers, stocked with core equipment, network, and environmental controls

        Testing Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery Plans

            Each plan should:
                - Validate that the plan functions correctly
                - Identify necessary changes needed to be made

            Types of tests:
                Read-through - Each team member is asked to review their role in a disaster recovery process and provide feedback
                Walk-through - The team is gathered together for a formal review of the disaster recovery plan
                Simulation - The team practices a scenario to test the plan
                Parallel test - the active disaster recovery environment is used but operations are not changed
                Full-interruption test - Switching primary operations and environment to fully test the plan

        After Action Reports

            - The aftermath of strategies and plans should be documented for improvement
