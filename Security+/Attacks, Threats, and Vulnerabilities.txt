    Malware

        Malware - Short for malicious software.

        Comparing Viruses, worms, and trojans

            Virus - Malware spread by human action
                    * The best way to prevent a virus is user education.

                Worm - Malware that spread by themselves
                    * Spreads from a host to other computers.
                    * The best way to prevent a worm is to update operating systems with official updates and patches.

                        * FIRST WORM -- RTM WORM
                        The first major worm outbreak was in 1988 and was called the RTM worm. 
                        Named after its designer, Robert T. Morris. 
                        It infected 10% of the internet at the time.
                        Eye-opening event for security

                        * STUXNET

                Examples are Microsoft Office macros, JavaScript code, and Windows registry persistence
        
        Understanding Botnets

            Botnet - A collection of 'zombie' computers that follow orders from a command and control (CNC) system
                Steal computing power, network bandwidth, and storage capacity of malicious means
                Spread through other forms of malware
                Used to deliver spam, engage in DDoS attacks, mine cryptocurrency, or perform brute force attacks
                Communications must be indirect and redundant 
                    Such as Internet relay chat (IRC)
                    Twitter accounts
                    Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communications within the botnet itself

                    Python - A general-purpose language used to create a diverse set of scripts.

    Understanding Attackers

            These attackers vary depending on any of the following:
                
                Internal or External
                Level of sophistication
                Access to resources
                Motivation
                Intent

            Examples of these attackers are:

                Script Kiddies - Unskilled attackers who simply reuse hacking tools developed by others.
                    Script kiddies are easily taken care of with basic security controls such as regular patching, endpoint security software, firewalls, and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

                Hacktivists - Seek to use hacking tools to advance political and social agendas
                    Usually working for a specific motivation

                Organized Crime - Criminal syndicates use hacking tools such as ransomware, for financial gain
                    May possess advanced technical skills and use them for a financial gain

                Corporate Espionage - Competitors may use hacking tools and techniques for corporate espionage purposes
                    Not limited to corporate levels, often used to obtain data that is confidential

                Nation-state - Sponsored and highly sophisticated advanced persistent threats (APT) groups
                    Often military units and very difficult to detect, and can attack civilians and other nations 

            Classifying Hackers by Hats

                White Hat Hackers - Operate with permission and good intent and are knowingly hacking a target with full permission to find security flaws in a system.
                Grey Hat hackers - Operate without permission but with good intent. This type of hacking is still illegal.
                Black Hat Hackers - Operate illegally with malicious intent.

            Preventing Insider Threats

                Insider threats - Risk of internal compromise from former and current employees, contractors, and other insiders who can exploit their privileged access to a system.

                FUN-FACT: 51% of organizations experiencing a security breach suffered an insider attack
                FUN-FACT: 67% of insider breaches were more costly than external attacks

                These insider attacks often occur within trusted users such as executives, IT professionals, and other trusted users.

                Privilege Escalation Attacks

                    Privilege Escalation Attacks - Take a normal account and escalate the privilege the account has allowing them to access more of a system

                To avoid insider attacks

                    Perform background checks to uncover past legal issues
                    Give users only the permissions that they need (principle of least privilege)
                    Require multiple users to carry out sensitive operations
                    Implement mandatory vacation for critical staff to potentially uncover fraud as the staff will be out of the office and unable to cover up their activity

                Shadow IT

                    Shadow IT - technology is brought into an organization by individual employees without the approval of IT professionals (USBs found in parking lots)

            Attack Vectors

                Attack vectors provide an attacker an initial way into the organization
            
                Examples of common attack vectors are:

                    Email - Used to send phishing messages with malicious content or ransomware
                    Social Media - Spread malware and can be used as part of an influence campaign
                    USB - Removable media such as USB drives may contain media that triggers when inserted into a new device that contains malicious content
                    Card Skimmers - Read magnetic stripes which may then be used to clone financial cards
                    Cloud Services - These services can be improperly secured for content and systems
                    Direct Access - Attackers can take advantage of direct access to a system through ethernet cables or open USB ports on systems and can easily compromise them.
                    Tampering with devices in the supply chain - attackers can insert a backdoor during the supply chain to grant access in the future
                    Wireless Networks - An easy way for attackers to gain access to an organization's network remotely

            Zero Days and APTs

                Zero Day attack - A vulnerability in a product that has not yet been patched by the vendor/author

                    The window of Vulnerability - The time between when the zero-day vulnerability is discovered and the time when the patch is released
                    
                    These attacks can be mitigated by installing recent patches provided by software authors as soon as they are available
                        Sometimes there are vulnerabilities in code even after a patch is released

                    When a vulnerability is found (ethically)

                        1. Notify the vendor of said vulnerabilities
                        2. Provide a reasonable amount of time for the vendor to fix the vulnerability
                        3. Disclose the vulnerability publicly

                    When a vulnerability is found (un-ethically)

                        Keep the vulnerability a secret from the author/vendor and use it to make a zero-day attack using the vulnerability

                Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

                    APT - Typically well-funded and highly skilled
                        - Typically government-sponsored such as military units
                        - Have access to zero-day attacks and other highly sophisticated weapons
                        - Work methodically to gain access to a target

                    To prevent an APT from attacking

                        - Implement strong security measures for a strong foundation (encryption and rigorous monitoring)

    Threat Intelligence
            
            Threat Intelligence
                    - Allows teams to stay up to date on current risks
                    - Set of activities that an organization undertakes to educate itself about changes in the cybersecurity threat landscape, and adapt security controls based upon that information

                    Open-source intelligence
                        - Security websites
                        - Vulnerability databases
                        - News media
                        - Social media

                        - Information-sharing centers
                        - File and code repositories
                        - Security researchers

                        Reading through all of this open-source information can take a lot of time. Therefore, many companies use proprietary and closed-source threat intelligence solutions using predictive analytics.
                            Products range from information briefs to real-time IP reputation information
                            Organizations may send these feeds directly to firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems, and other security tools to block access from suspect IP addresses
                            A cool example of a real-time IP reputation system is on the homepage of https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/
                        
                        Evaluation of a Security source
                            Timeliness - How quickly will the source publish information about the threat?
                            Accuracy - How accurate is the data delivered by the source?
                            Reliability - How often is the source correct in what they say or post?
                
            Managing Threat Indicators

                Threat Indicator - Properties that describe a threat (Ex. IP addresses, malicious file signatures, communication patterns)

            Sharing threat Indicators

                    Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) - Standardized scheme for categorizing security observations with like-minded individuals
                        Used to share properties we can share to describe intrusion attempts, malicious software, and other observable security events

                    Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) - Used to share information between systems inside an organization

                        STIX but automated


                    CybOX - Provides the Shema that we can use to classify different threats and is used to define the information elements for different languages 
                        *EXAM TIP - cybOX is not covered on the exam, but STIX and TAXII are

                    OpenIOC - Mandiant (produced by FireEye) threat framework
                        Provides data such as file size and instructions in .dll files

                    Security tools and services should support a standardized information scheme to produce and consume data efficiently.
            
            Intelligence Sharing

                TAXII, STIX, and CybOX all facilitate information sharing.

                Information sharing is beneficial for:
                    - Incident Response Teams
                    - Vulnerability Management Teams
                    - Risk Management Teams
                    - Security Engineering Teams

            Threat Research
                - Threat research uses threat intelligence to get inside the minds of our adversaries
                
                Techniques Used in threat research
                    - Reputational threat research - Identify potentially malicious actors based on their use of IP addresses, email addresses, domains, etc. that were used previously in attacks
                    - Behavioral threat research - Identify potentially malicious actors based on the similarities of past attackers

                Research sources
                    - Vendor websites
                    - Vulnerability feeds
                    - Cybersecurity conferences

            Identifying Threats

                Use a structured approach to threat management

                    Asset Focus - Use the asset inventory as the basis for the analysis (system by system)
                    Threat Focus - Identify how specific threats may affect each information system (classifying actors and how they can affect systems)
                    Service Focus - Identify the impact of various threats on a specific service (each threat that can affect an interface)

            Automating Threat Intelligence

                Automating the blacklisting of IP addresses from threat feeds (firewalls, IPSs, and routers)
                    Potentially causing service disruptions
                    Alert-only-mode to allow access but to alert IT professionals of the threat actor's interest
                    Use a variety of threat feeds to have a larger list of blacklisted IP addresses and for more filtering
                
                Incident Response
                    Manual process that requires prior knowledge and personal experience
                    Data Enrichment - Automatically supplements incident data for faster incident response time

                    Example: An IP address is known to have visited or communicated with a system within an organization
                        1. Perform source address reconnaissance including IP address ownership and geo-location
                        2. Search for related logs such as similar IP addresses or similar attack strategies
                        3. Trigger a vulnerability scan on the targeted system

                Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms enhance SIEM capabilities

            Threat Hunting

                Not every possible type of system is impenetrable. We must make the "assumption of compromise".

                Threat Hunting - An organized, systematic approach to seeking out indicators of compromise on our networks using expertise and analytic techniques.
                    Think like the attackers
                    
                    1. Establish a hypothesis based on the profile and activities, threat feeds, or vulnerability advisories/bulletins
                    2. Find the indicators of compromise
                        Unusual binary files
                        Expected process or resource consumption
                        Deviation in network traffic
                        Unexplained log entries
                        Unapproved configuration file changes
                        
                        Searching for these indicators is the core work of threat hunting

                    3. Move into Incident Response Process
                        Look for signs as to how the attacker might have moved throughout the system
                        Start the processes of containment, eradication, and recovery

    Social Engineering Attacks

        Social Engineering

            Human Threats to Cybersecurity
            - Manipulate people into divulging information or performing an action that undermines security

                Authority - People are more likely to listen to someone with authority, creating trust
                Intimidation - scaring and threatening them to comply
                Consensus - The herd mentality/peer pressure
                Scarcity - A perceived limited amount of something
                Urgency - Time is running out
                Familiarity - Being liked causes people to say 'yes' more often

            Preventing Social Engineering
                Education about these attacks
                Awareness of common attacks and attack types

        Impersonating Attacks

            Spam - Unsolicited commercial email
                Used for a variety of marketing and identify fraud purposes
                Most spam is illegal under the CAN-SPAM ACT

            Phishing - A sub-category of spam, with the explicit purpose of obtaining information
                Often used in the reconnaissance phase of an attack

                Pre-heading - adding tags such as [URGENT] or [SAFE] to create a sense of urgency/trust
            
            Spear-Phishing - Sending a phishing attack to a targeted individual such as employees at a small company
                Using company jargon or mentioning business leaders improves the likelihood of a successful attack
                Commonly use invoice-related attacks, in hopes of someone approving the invoice without confirming the invoice

            Whaling - Sending a phishing attack to a targeted individual such as a senior executive of a company
                Sending fake court documents such as a subpoena or a recognition of being sued

            Pharming - Using a fake website that is visited by phishing attacks routing to the site (Steam lookalikes)
                Can also use DNS poisoning to get users to the site
                Copy the look and feel of a real site and harvest credentials from users who believe the sites are the same

            Vishing - Voice phishing attacks to sound like a relative or important business
                "Hello this is your bank calling, we have been notified that someone has accessed your account, please confirm your SSN"
                The goal is for sensitive information

            Smishing/SPIM - SMS and instant messaging spam attacks
                Attacks began via AOL and often use spoofing

            Spoofing - Masking or faking an identity to pose as someone trusted or important

        Identity Fraud and pretexting

            Identity fraud - Targeting single individuals such as with spear-phishing or whaling
            
            Pre-texting - Attempting to pose as a consumer and gain access to the user's account

        Watering hole attacks

            Watering hole attack - Commonly use malicious code in a browser or browser extension to execute code on particular sites, often causing pop-up warnings
                When a user visits a site, they have some trust in the site
                Web browsers and add-ons often have vulnerabilities

                Attackers create malware on a site and can wait for users to come to the site

                1. Attacker chooses a highly visited, and compromised site to infect
                2. Attacker chooses a client exploit and can bundle in the joining to of a botnet
                3. Attacker places the malware on the compromised website
                4. Attacker waits for clients to join the botnet or do whatever the malicious code instructs such as obey a command and control system

        Physical social engineering

            Shoulder-surfing - The attacker simply watches someone's screen, learning confidential information
                To prevent shoulder-surfing - be aware of your surrounding and use a privacy filter

            Dumpster diving - Digging through trash to find anything useful such as sensitive information
                To prevent dumpster diving - use a paper shredder or a degausser to wipe information before being thrown away

            Tailgating - slipping in somewhere behind someone such as in a man trap, or by holding a door open for somebody
                To prevent tailgating - Education enforcing authentication at doors and entrances

    Common Attacks

        Password Attacks
            On Linx systems, passwords are stored in a password file often stored in the /etc/password. The password is hashed using a one-way function
                To prevent the sharing of passwords, remove the password hashes from the /etc/password file. The hashes still exist in the /etc/shadow file

                    The Linux command ./unshadow combines the hashes of a user's password and username into a single file

                Hash Function - A mathematical function that converts a variable-length input into a fixed-length output in a matter that is collision-resistant.
                    - Each output must be completely different from the input
                    - It must computationally be difficult to retrieve the input from the output
                    - It must be computationally difficult to find two inputs that result in the same output
                
                Collision is when two or more inputs/outputs share a reciprocal (output/input)
                    Birthday problem - Collisions become very common when large samples sizes are used
                        - 367 people in a room 100% chance for 2 of them to share a birthday
                        - 70 people in a room 99.9% chance for 2 of them to share a birthday
                        - 23 people in a room 50% chance for 2 of them to share a birthday
                
            Brute Force Attack - The attacker tries all possibilities until one is correct

            Dictionary Attack - Assuming people use words for passwords, try all English words as passwords

            Hybrid Attacks - Assuming people use words for passwords, words, special characters, and numbers are mixed with words as passwords, + L33t and other character replacement options

            Rainbow table Attacks - Comparing hashes against a list of pre-computed hashes to find the matching hash

        Password Spraying and credential stuffing

            Password spraying - trying common passwords (rockyou.txt.gz) to attack many different accounts at the same time

            Credential stuffing - After obtaining a user's password, using the same, reused, password on different sites or systems

            To avoid these attacks
                Password spraying - Implement a password requirement using length, and special characters or check against a list of common passwords
                Credential stuffing - Promote the use of a password generator and password manager to maintain unique passwords
                Multi-Factor-Authentication (MFA) - requires users to have a secondary form of authentication not including a password

        Adversarial Artificial Intelligence

            Machine learning - A computer system discovers knowledge in data

            Artificial Intelligence - A computer system simulates human thought

                Descriptive Analytics - Describe our data through computational questions (What portion of customers are female?)

                Predictive Analytics - Trying to predict the future by looking at previously collected data

                Prescriptive Analytics - Seek to simulate possible options and optimize outcomes

            Adversarial AI - Exploits AI techniques as listed above
                - Could work to breach the confidentiality of machine learning algorithms
                - Could inject tainted training data for inaccurate data sets
                - Could try to fool working algorithms

                    Tesla Model X read a 35 MPH road sign as 85 because of a piece of tape in the 3

    Understanding Vulnerability Types

        Vulnerability Impact
            Vulnerabilities expose us to the risk of a security breach

            Goals of Information Security (CIA Triad)
                Confidentiality - The data is only accessible by authorized individuals
                    The act of a lack of confidentiality is called data exfiltration
                    An attack seeking to break confidentiality is called a disclosure attack

                Integrity - There cannot be unauthorized changes to data from unauthorized sources
                    An attack seeking to break confidentiality is called an alteration attack

                Availability - Data and sources are accessible to authorized individuals when needed
                    An attack seeking to break confidentiality is called a denial of service attack (DoS attack)

            Risks

                Financial - The risk of monetary damage or loss to an organization or person
                    Ransomware demanding money in exchange for system access to be returned

                Reputational - When negative publicity is spread among customers, employees, suppliers, and stakeholders
                    News spreads that a large company has had a data breach, people are less likely to want to do business with them

                Strategic - A risk that an organization will become less effective at meeting its major goals or objectives
                    An employee loses their laptop, This can delay development
                    A Competitor can obtain the said laptop, and develop a product before the employee's company can

                Operational - The risk of the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks
                
                Compliance - Risk involving a potential violation of laws or regulations
                    Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
            
        Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

            An important vendor-related issue is an announcement of and End of Life (EOL) of certain systems and software used in the supply chain
                Related to patches for systems and security updates

            Common phrases similar to End-of-Life

                End-of-Sale - Products will no longer be offered for purchase, but the vendor will still support existing customers

                End-of-Support - The vendor will reduce or eliminate support for existing users of the product. This very very close to EOL

                End-of-Life - the vendor no longer provides support or updates for the product

            Vendors can still fail to provide adequate support for existing products

            Vendors can also use embedded systems that are not disclosed to you as a user, this embedded system must also be maintained, but it relies to be supported by the vendor

            Using cloud storage for data, the vendor is supposed to manage many risks on your behalf, the vendor must provide access to the data in the future along with the rest of the CIA triad in the future

        Configuration Vulnerabilities

            A common mistake is using a system directly from a vendor or manufacturer in a production setting or on their network without modifying the default configurations
                This includes :
                    - misconfigured firewalls
                    - Open permissions
                    - Guest accounts
                    - Default accounts (root/admin)
                    - Default password (toor/admin)
                    - Unsecured root accounts

                    - Weak cipher suites
                    - Weak cryptographic protocol implementation
                        This can lead to all data going to and from systems related to the vulnerability to eavesdropping and tampering
                    - Poor key management
                    - Poor certificate management

                    To avoid these vulnerabilities, follow documented security standards and baselines when configuring systems and applications
            
            Patch management
                Systems receive all recent security updates/fixes for operating systems, applications, and firmware
            
            Account management
                Carefully configure accounts and permissions assigned to the individual accounts to prevent accidental or intentional misuse
                    To avoid improper account management, use the principle of least privilege, only giving accounts access to what they need and nothing more

        Architectural Vulnerabilities

            IT Architecture - A set of well-defined practices and processes used to design systems
                A good practice is to implement security in the planning phase of a design and not as an after-thought
                Untrained users and weak business processes can be just as dangerous as a technical flaw

            System Sprawl - New devices are connected to a network but, old devices are still not promptly disconnected leading to security vulnerabilities
                This is an even bigger risk when the old systems or assets are undocumented
