Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities (24%)

-- Malware

    Short for malicious software.

    Each malware has a propagation mechanism and a payload.
        
        Propagation mechanism - The way that malware objects spread

        Payload - The malicious action that the malware performs 
            * Any malware can carry any payload.

            Adware - Malware that displays advertisements.
                Generates revenue for the malware author instead of the advertisement creator
                    Can redirect search queries to a search engine controlled by the malware author or one with which the malware author has a partnership agreement.
                    Display pop-up advertisements that the user might blame the website for
                    Replace legitimate ads with ads from the malware author

            Spyware - Malware that gathers information without the user's knowledge.
                The information is sent back to the malware author who can use the information for any purpose such as identity theft or to access financial accounts.
                    keystroke loggers - capture every key the user presses, or they can monitor users visiting certain websites and recording usernames and passwords.
                    Monitoring web browsing - monitors web queries to later target advertisements to the user.
                    Search hard drives or cloud storage - searches through storage media to find records such as social security numbers or anything that can be useful to the actor.
                Potentially Unwanted programs (PUPs) - programs that are slipped onto a system by the software installers.

            Ransomware - Blocking access to parts of a computer in exchange for services or finances.
                Normally encrypting files behind an encrypted key and selling the key (WannaCry)
                * WannaCry spread during 2017, exploiting EternalBlue Windows vulnerability
                * Encrypted files and demanded Bitcoin as a ransom

            Crypto-malware - a form of malware that takes over the capacity of a user's system to mine cryptocurrency.
                * (EXAM TIP) It is easy to confuse ransomware and crypto-malware

            Tips to avoid Adware, Spyware, ransomware, and crypto-malware
                Installing and updating antimalware and antivirus software on systems
                Applying security patches promptly
                User education
            
            Backdoors - A programmer provides a means to grant themselves or others future access to a system.
                Usually done with good intent such as ParSec or TeamViewer but can have unintended side-effects.
                    hardcoded accounts - Accounts made on a system with the purpose of a later use
                    Default passwords - A password that works with an account that might be changed or known
                    Unknown access channels - A way to gain access to a system without going through the normal authentication
    
            Logic Bombs - Malware that is set to execute a payload when certain conditions are met.
                Date/Time reached (Zero Day)
                File contents are changed
                API calls
            
            Tips to avoid backdoors and logic bombs
                Routinely change default passwords
                Disable unused accounts
                Monitor security bulletins for news

            Virus - Malware spread by human action
                * The best way to prevent a virus is user education.

            Worm - Malware that spread by themselves
                * Spreads from a host to other computers.
                * The best way to prevent a worm is to update operating systems with official updates and patches.

                    * FIRST WORM -- RTM WORM
                    The first major worm outbreak was in 1988 and was called the RTM worm. 
                    Named after its designer, Robert T. Morris. 
                    It infected 10% of the internet at the time.
                    Eye-opening event for security

                    * STUXNET
                    Stuxnet was created in 2010 to infiltrate an Iranian nuclear enrichment facility.
                    It was the first worm to cross the virtual/physical barrier in a major way.
                    Damaged uranium enrichment equipment by causing centrifuges to spin out of control

            Trojan Horse - Malware that is disguised to be a beneficial software
                * Software does perform as expected but also delivers malicious payload behind the scenes
                * The best way to prevent a trojan horse attack is to use application control to limit what applications can do on a system.

            Remote Access Trojan (RAT) - Malware that provides a backdoor to hacked systems

    Advanced malware

        Rootkits - Malware that is used to escalate a users privilege on a system
            Root accounts - A special superuser account that provides unrestricted access to system resources.
            Can be used to install backdoors, botnet agents, adware/spyware, and anti-theft mechanisms on systems

            User mode rootkits
                Run with normal user privileges
                Fairly easy to write and difficult to detect

            Kernal mod rootkits
                Run with system privileges
                Are difficult to write and easy to detect
                
        Fileless virus - a virus that remains in memory without a file present
            Examples are Microsoft Office macros, JavaScript code, and Windows registry persistence

        Botnet - A collection of 'zombie' computers that follow orders from a command and control (CNC) system
            Steal computing power, network bandwidth, and storage capacity of malicious means
            Spread through other forms of malware
            Used to deliver spam, engage in DDoS attacks, mine cryptocurrency or perform brute force attacks
            Communications must be indirect and redundant 
                Such as Internet relay chat (IRC)
                Twitter accounts
                Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communications within the botnet itself

            1. Infect machines with malware
            2. Convert to bots in the botnet
            3. Spread the infection to other machines
            4. Check in with the CNC
            5. Wait for instructions
            6. Deliver payloads
