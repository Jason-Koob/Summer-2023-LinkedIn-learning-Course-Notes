        What You Need To Know

    Cloud Computing

        What Is The Cloud?
            - Delivering resources to a remote customer over a network
            - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

        Cloud Computing Roles
            Cloud service provider - offers cloud computing services for sale to third parties
            Cloud customer - purchase cloud computing services from one or more cloud service providers

            Cloud service partner - Provider add-no services

            Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) - Provide identity and access management (IAM) services

        Drivers For Cloud Computing

            On-demand self-service - Available when you need it
            Scalability - Increasing capacity with demand
                Horizontal Scaling - Adds more servers to the pool to meet increased demand
                Vertical Scaling - adding more resources to existing servers to meet increased demands
            Elasticity - Expanding and contracting quickly
            Broad Network Access - Anytime, anywhere access
            Measured Service - Paying for what you consume

        Multitenent Computing
            - Multiple customers using the same resource independently of each other
                - Isolation - customers should not be able to tell any information about each other
                - Oversubscription - Sold capacity exceeds actual capacity (airlines over-booking flights)
                    - Resource Pooling - CPU and memory are shared among users

        Cost-Benefit Analysis

            - Is the cloud worth it?

            Tangible Factors 
                - Electricity costs
                - Data center facility rental, acquisition, maintenance
                - Training costs
                - Consulting services
                - Staff time

            Intangible Factors
                - Increased productivity and agility
                - Improved scalability and elasticity
                - Faster access to emerging technologies
                - Transition from capital to operational expenditures
                - Fun

        Security Service Problems

            Managed Service Providers (MSP)
                - Offer services to customers
            
            Managed Security Service Providers (MSSP)
                - Provide security services to other organizations as a service

                Potential Tasks:
                    - Manage an entire security infrastructure
                    - Monitor system logs
                    - Manage firewalls or networks
                    - Perform identity and access management

                *EXAM TIP* - MSSPs may also be referred to as Security as a service (SECaaS)
            
            Cloud Access Security Brokers add a third-party security layer to the interaction that users have with other cloud services
                Network-based CASB - Broker intercepts traffic between the user and  the cloud service, monitoring for security issues
                    - Broker can block requests
                API-based CASB - The broker queries the cloud service via API
                    - Broker may not be able to block requests, depending on the API capabilities

    Virtualization

        Virtualization
            The host machine has un-used physical hardware
            Host machine provides services to several virtualized guest machines
            - The host machine runs software known as a hypervisor which tricks each guest into thinking it is running on dedicated hardware

            Type 1 Hypervisor
                - The hypervisor is right above the hardware with the guests on top of the hypervisor

            Type 2 Hypervisor
                - The physical machine runs an operating system of its own and the hypervisor hosting the guest operating systems

            Virtualization Security
                - Each virtual machine is isolated (critical)
                - Each server must have access to only its memory and storage
                    If a virtual machine can use other resources not dedicated to it, this is called a VM escape attack

            VM Sprawl - A large number of unused and unmaintained servers/virtual machines
        
        Desktop and Application Virtualization

            Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
                - Provides network-based access to a desktop computing environment
                    - Example - Amazon Workspaces

            Application Virtualization
                - Streams applications to the user's desktop

    Cloud Building Blocks

        Cloud Compute Resources

            Resources can be allocated within seconds to a virtual machine
                CPU
                RAM
                Storage
                Network connection
                Operating system

        Cloud Storage

            Block Storage
                - Allocating a large chunk of storage for access as a disk volume managed by the operating system
                    - Magnetic drives (slower)
                    - Solid State (faster)

            Object Storage
                - Stores files as individual objects managed by the cloud service provider
                    - High Availability (always online)
                    - Archival (online when needed)

            - Most enterprise computing environments need both block and object storage

        Cloud Networking

            Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
                - Similar to VLANs
            
            Cloud networks are managed with Software-defined Networking (SDN)

            Software-defined Visibility (SDV)
                - Allows management to have external visibility of systems and resources

        Cloud Databases

            Options include:
                Building a virtualized server
                    - Spinning up a server and installing Databases
                
                Managed database service
                    - The service provider acts as the database administrator but costs more for the customer

                Cloud-native database platform
                    - Using a database system designed to work in the cloud

        Cloud Orchestration

            Automated cloud management

                Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
                    - Management should never manage systems from the command line or GUI
                    - Instead, they should write code that manages these systems for them

        Containers

            Container
                - Lightweight application virtualization

                Containers work above the containerization platform instead of needing a secondary operating system for each application

            Community Cloud:
                - Public cloud for a selected group of individuals

        Cloud Service Catagories

            XaaS - Anything as a Service

            SaaS - Software as a Service
                - Customer purchases the entire app (Gmail)

            PaaS - Platform as a Service or FaaS - Function as a Service
                - Customers purchase servers storage (AWS)

            IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
                - Customers purchase app platform
                - Middle ground between SaaS and PaaS

        Edge and Fog Computing

            Internet of Things - IoT

            Edge Computing - Computers on the endpoint
                - Processors on the IoT devices that send data to be analyzed

            Fog Computing - Computing near the endpoint
                - Processors on a separate device close to the IoT device which then sends the data to be analyzed

        Security and Privacy Concerns In The Cloud

            CIA TRIAD:
                - Confidentiality
                    - Protects information and systems from unauthorized access
                
                - Integrity
                    - Protects data from being altered by unauthorized sources

                - Availability
                    - Allows data to be accessed when an authorized individual when needed
                
                - Privacy
                    - Protects the confidentiality rights of individuals whose information we store, process and transmit

                - Regular audits verify cloud service providers are fulfilling their security and operational obligations

                Defense-in-Depth - having multiple preventative measures restricting the same object at multiple levels of system configurations

        Data Sovereignty

            Cloud service providers intentionally spread data across many different geographic locations for ease of access and to protect against regional failures

            Data Sovereignty - Local laws apply to data stored there

        Operational Concerns in the Cloud

            Availability
                - How much uptime is required?

            Resiliency
                - How many failures are tolerable?

            - All of these concerns should be addressed in a Sevice Level Agreement (SLA) before subscribing to the service provider

            Other important concerns that are more prevalent on the cloud are:

                Reversibility
                    - Can a change be rolled back to a previous state before a modification

                Portability
                    - Can a system be moved to a different location or system easily

                Interoperability
                    - Can cloud providers work together between different products

    Cloud Security Controls

        Cloud Firewall Considerations

            Network security groups
                - Serve as IaaS firewalls

        Cloud Application Security

            Application Virtualization
                - Centralizes sensitive data

            Secure web gateway
                - Filter web traffic entering and leaving a network or device

        Cloud Provider Security Controls

            Resource policy
                - Limit cloud service usage

            Transit gateway
                - A link between on-premises and cloud networks 
            
            Secrets management
                - protects keys and other sensitive credentials
