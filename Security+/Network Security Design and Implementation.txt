        Introducing TCP/IP

            Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

                Internet Protocol
                    - Routers information across networks
                    - Provides an addressing scheme
                    - Delivers packets from source to destination
                    - Serves as a network layer protocol
                
                Transmission Control Protocol

                    Transmission Control Protocol
                        - Connection-oriented
                        - Reliable through acknowledgment of delivery
                        - Widely used for critical applications

                    User datagram Protocol (UDP)
                        - Lightweight connectionless protocol
                        - No acknowledgment
                        - Used for voice and video applications

                Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI)

                Layer 1 - Physical - wires, radios, and optics
                Layer 2 - Data Link - Data transfers between nodes
                Layer 3 - Networking - Internet protocol
                Layer 4 - Transport - TCP and UDP
                Layer 5 - Session - Exchanges between Systems
                Layer 6 - Presentation - Data translation and encryption
                Layer 7 - Application - User programs

        IP Addresses and DHCP

            IP Addresses - Uniquely addressing Devices
                Dotted Quad Notation 192.168.x.x
                
                Binary
                    0-255 range
                    Each byte has 8 bits
                    Each bit is either 0 or 1 in binary
                    These bits can range from 00000001 to 11111111

                    11000000	10101000	000000000	000000000
                    192	        168	        0	        0


                - Not reusable on internet-connected Systems
                - May be reused if on private networks

                Network Addresses
                    - Each IP address belongs to a network address
                    - The network address is the first address used in a subnet

            Subnets
                - Subnets are ranges of addresses.
                - notated in CIDR (Example /24 == 255.255.255.0)
                - The larger the number, the fewer addresses in that range

                11111111	11111111	11111111	000000000
                255	        255	        255	        0
            
            IPv6
                - Implemented dues to IPv4 address exhaustion
                - Uses 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits

                dea6	2d50	cd16	b134	3dbc	7cd5	5882	a85c

            Static IPs
                - Static IPs are manually assigned to a system by an administrator
            
            DHCP
                - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns unused addresses to devices per request from a pool

        Domain Name System (DNS)

            - Translates URLs to IP address
            - Port UDP 53
            - Hierarchical system, asking next level if the answer is unknown

            DNSSEC
                - Adds a digital signature to DNS records

        Network Ports

            - 16-bit binary number (2^16) up to 65535
            
            Ranges

    Secure Network Design

        Security Zones

            Network Border Firewall
                - Internet connection is filtered by the Firewall
                - Used to segment external, internal, and DMZ segments

            Extranet - Special intranet zone allowed to be used by select business partners
            
            Honeynet  Decoy networks are designed to lure attackers

            Ad Hoc Network - Temporary networks that may bypass security controls

            East-West Traffic - Traffic between devices on the same network

            North-South Traffic - Network traffic that passes through a network border

        VLANs and Network Segmentation

            VLAN - Separate systems on a network through virtual, logical groups, regardless of physical location
                - Devices on the same VLAN can contact each other as if they were on the same network switch

        Security Device Placement

            Place filtering devices near the edge of networks
            Placing network sensors can only log the traffic on the network it is attached to
        
        Software-defined networking (SDN)

            Functionality and Implementation are two different things

                Control Plane - responsible for making routing and switching decisions
                Data Plane - Responsible for carrying out the instructions of the control plane

            Benefits of using SDN-configured networks:
                - Allows for very granular configurations
                - facilitates faster response to security incidents

            SDNs are also programmable causing them to be complex

    Network Security Devices

        Routers, Switches, and Bridges

        Firewalls

            Firewalls - Filter network activity on and between networks
                - Normally placed near the edges of networks
                    - Or between larger networks like the internet, DMZ, and internal networks
                
            Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - Isolated network zone containing systems that must accept direct external connections

            Stateless Firewall - Firewall evaluates each connection independently each time a new packet is sent or received

            Stateful Inspection - Firewall tracks open connections

            Firewall Rules:
                - Source system addresses
                - Destination system addresses
                - Destination port and protocol
                - Action (allow or deny)

            Implicit Deny - Deny all explicitly allowed connections

            NAT Gateway - Firewalls can prove to protect networks using Network Address Translation (NAT)

        Proxy Servers

                - Content filtering(URL too)

            Forward Proxy - The client communicates with a known proxy server which then relays to the external server(clients-side)

            Reverse Proxy - The known client contacts a proxy server thinking it is the legitimate server(server-side)

            Transparent Proxy - Both the client and the server communicate with each other through the proxy server (client/server-side)

        Load Balancers

            The workload is distributed through multiple servers

                Round-Robin Scheduling
                    - Each request is given to a different server in a sequence

            Active-Active - Two or more load balancers work together to handle traffic

            Active-Passive - One load balancer works as a primary device, and a secondary stands as a backup

        VPNs and VPN Concentrators

            Site-to-Site VPN - Connect remote offices and headquarters

            Remote Access - Provide remote access to corporate networks for mobile users

                - Supports Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

            Full-Tunnel VPN - All traffic going to or from the internet is routed through the VPN

            Split-Tunnel VPN - Only traffic through select VPNs is managed through the VPN

            *EXAM TIP* - Split-Tunnel VPNs give users a false sense of security

        Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention

            Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - Monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity

            Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - Inspects network traffic and blocks malicious activity

                    - Anomaly Detection System - Develops baselines of normal activity and alerts each anomaly
                
                IPS Deployment Methods:
                    - In-band (inline) - All network traffic routes through the system
                    - Out-of-band (passive) - The device monitors traffic without requiring a route through the device (SPAN switch port)

                Standard - IP filtering
                    access-list[number] [permit/deny][source][dest]
                
                Extended - Block based on src, destination IPs and ports, and protocols

    Transport Encryption

        TLS and SSL

            Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                - Encrypts network data over un-trusted networks

                *EXAM TIP* - TLS uses other algorithms and functions, it does not do any encryption itself

                1. Client asks a server to use TLS (client suite)
                2. Server responds and sends a digital signature
                3. Client checks the signature through a trusted CA
                4. CA responds
                5. Client makes a session and encrypts it with the server's public key
