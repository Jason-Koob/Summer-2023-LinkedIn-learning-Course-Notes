Operations and Incident Response

    Introduction

        Operations and Incident Response

            Contains the damage
            Determines the root cause
            Resolves the issue
            Recovers normal operations as quickly as possible
        
    Incident Response Programs

        Build An Incident Response Program

            Incident Response Plan
                - A structured plan including steps when an incident occurs

            Incident Response Plan Elements:
                - Statement of Purpose:
                    - What type of incidents does the plan cover
                - Strategies and goals for incident response
                    - What is the plan for protecting
                - Approach
                - Communication with other members and groups
                - Senior leadership approval
            
            NIST SP 800-61 can be used to develop a plan

        Creating An Incident Response Team

            The team should be available 24/7

            Members should include:
                - Management
                - Information Security personnel
                - Subject matter experts
                - Legal Counsel
                - Public Affairs
                - Human Resources
                - Physical security
            
            Work with team members regularly

        Incident Communications Plan

            Limit publicity of the incident
                Most incidents don't require law enforcement notification

            Use secure communication channels
                - Prevents inadvertent leaks of information about the incident

        Incident Identification

            Monitoring is crucial
                - IPS/IDS
                - Firewalls
                - Authentication systems
                - Integrity monitors
                - Vulnerability scanners
                - System event logs
                - NetFlow records
                - Antimalware packages

                - SIEM

            Incidents may be found by external sources

            *EXAM TIP* - First responder's  primary priority is to contain the damage

        Escalation and Notification

            Goals:
                - Evaluate the incident severity
                - Escalate to the appropriate level
                - Notify management and other stakeholders

            Assessing severity:
                - Low
                    - Minimal or no potential to affect security
                    - Normally handled by first responders
                    - Normally don't require an after-hours response
                - Moderate
                    - Have a significant effect on security
                    - Trigger incident response team activation
                    - Prompt notification of management
                - High
                    - May cause critical damage to information or systems
                    - Justify an immediate, full response
                    - Require immediate notification to senior management
                    - Demands full mobilization of the incident response team

        Mitigation

            Goal:
                - Controlling the damage to the organization through containment

            Evaluating containment strategies:
                - Check the potential for damage
                - Find a need for evidence preservation
                - Service availability
                - Time and resource requirements
                - Expected effectiveness
                - Solution time frame

            Balance business needs with security objectives

            Attackers may be alerted when containment starts

        Containment Techniques

            Techniques:
                Segmentation
                    - split a large area into smaller areas, that are easier to manage
                Isolation
                    - Prevent the split area from communicating
                Removal
                    - Completely disconnect the isolated systems

        Incident Eradication and Recovery

            Eradication
                - Remove any traces of an incident

            Recovery
                - Restore normal operations
                    Apply security patches

            Security practices:
                - Application whitelisting/blacklisting
                - Quarantine
                - Access Controls

                - Modify firewall rules
                - Mobile Device Management (MDM)
                - Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
                - URL filtering
                - Update/revoke compromised digital certificates

            Sanitizing techniques:
                - Clearing - overwrite to frustrate casual analysis
                - Purging - more advanced techniques to frustrate laboratory analysis
                - Destroying - completely obliterates media

        Validation

            Validation process:
                - Verify the secure configuration of every system
                - Run vulnerability scans
                - Perform account and permission reviews
                - Verify that systems are logging and communicating security information to the SIEM

        Post-Incident Activities

            Post-Incident Activities:
                - Lessons learned
                    - Reflect on the incident
                        - How well did staff and management perform?
                        - Were documented procedures followed?
                            - Were those procedures adequate?
                        - What would staff and management do differently?
                        - How could information sharing be improved?
                        - What could prevent a similar incident in the future?
                        - What should the organization watch for?
                        - What additional tools or resources are needed?
                - Evidence retention
                    - Storing of evidence after the incident
                - Indicator of compromise generation
                    - Incorporate new indicators of compromise in your security monitoring program

        Introduction to Forensics

            The goal of digital forensics:
                - Collect, preserve, analyze, and interpret digital evidence

            Investigators must never alter evidence, or else the chain is custody is broken

            Volatility
                - The relative permanence of a piece of evidence; evidence that may not last long is more volatile than more permanent sources of evidence

            Order of volatility:
                - Network traffic
                - Memory contents
                - System configurations and process data
                - Files (temporary too)
                - Logs
                - Archived records

        System and File Forensics

            Create copies or images of the evidence and use the copy to gather evidence

            Hashes protect evidence
                - They provide a unique file signature that changes if a modification has been made

            File meta-data shows more information about files
