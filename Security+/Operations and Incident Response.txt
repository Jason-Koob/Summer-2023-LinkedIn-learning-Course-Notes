    Introduction

        Operations and Incident Response

            Contains the damage
            Determines the root cause
            Resolves the issue
            Recovers normal operations as quickly as possible
        
    Incident Response Programs

        Build An Incident Response Program

            Incident Response Plan
                - A structured plan including steps when an incident occurs

            Incident Response Plan Elements:
                - Statement of Purpose:
                    - What type of incidents does the plan cover
                - Strategies and goals for incident response
                    - What is the plan for protecting
                - Approach
                - Communication with other members and groups
                - Senior leadership approval
            
            NIST SP 800-61 can be used to develop a plan

        Creating An Incident Response Team

            The team should be available 24/7

            Members should include:
                - Management
                - Information Security personnel
                - Subject matter experts
                - Legal Counsel
                - Public Affairs
                - Human Resources
                - Physical security
            
            Work with team members regularly
