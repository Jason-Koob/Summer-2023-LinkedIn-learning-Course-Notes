Identity and Access Management Design and Implementation

    Introduction

        Identity and Access Management Design and Implementation
            - Perform Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

    Identification

        Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
            
            Access Control
                - Identification
                - Authentication
                - Authorization

                Identification
                    - An individual claims their identity without any proof of this claim
                    - Username

                Authentication
                    - The individual proves their claim with satisfactory evidence to support their claim
                    - Password

                Authorization
                    - The individual is allowed access to the requested system
                    - Access Control Lists (ACL)

                *EXAM TIP* Identification, Authentication, and Authorization are separate and distinct steps

                Accounting
                    - Allows management to track user activity
                    - log files
                
                - Identity and access management systems should work across cloud and on-premises environments

        Usernames and Access Cards

            Usernames
                - Usually easy to identify individual
                - Often consist of a first initial and last name
                - Should not be considered secret

            Access Cards
                - Often serve as proof of employment
                - May perform both identification and authentication

                Magnetic Stripe Cards
                    - Can easily be duplicated
                
                Smart Cards
                    - Contain a small chip to prove authenticity
                
                Card Readers
                    - Cards must be inserted into the reader for information to be read
                
                Proximity Cards
                    - Cards must be in a close range to the reader for information to be read
                    - Uses passive cards
                        - The reader energizes the chip, providing power to read the data on the card

        Biometrics

            Provide a means to identify someone based on one or more physical characteristics

            Effective systems provide:
                - Easy enrollment
                - Low false acceptance rates
                - Low false rejection rates
                - Low intrusiveness

            Options include:
                - Fingerprint scanners
                - Eye scans
                - Voiceprint matching (replay attacks)
                - Facial recognition

    Authentication

        Authentication Factors
        
            Three main authentication methods
                - Something you know (password)
                    - Complex string of letters, numbers, and special characteristics
                    - Passphrases work well (ThisIsAStr0ngPassw0rd~!)
                    - Password keys are an alternative (Private keys)
                - Something you are (Biometrics)
                - Something you have (Keypass or keyfob)

            Others include:
                - Somewhere you are (office building address)
                - Something you can do (Typing patterns)
                - Something you exhibit (personality trait)
                - Someone you know (colleague)

                *EXAM TIP* These other authentication methods are not widely accepted

            Failures:
                - False acceptance
                    - System misidentifies an individual as an authorized user
                    - The frequency of these failures is measured by their False Acceptance Rate (FAR)

                - False rejection
                    - System misidentifies an authorized user
                    - The frequency of these failures is measured by their False Rejection Rate (FRR)

                Both of these failure measurements should ideally be equal equating to a Crossover Error Rate (CER)

        Multifactor Authentication

            Multifactor Authentication
                - Using multiple authentication methods (Something you know + something you have)
                    - Fingerprint + PIN
                
                - Both factors should use different methods
                    - Do not use a security question and a password for authentication

        Something You Have

            Physical token // Authentication App - Something you have

            Username // Password - Something you know

            Retina Scanner - Something you are

            Protocols for generating One-Time-Passwords (OTP)

                HMAC-based One-Time-Password (HOTP) - Uses a shared secret and an incrementing counter to generate the code displayed on the token

                Time-based One-Time-Password (TOTP) - Uses the time of the day in conjunction with the shared secret
                    - The token and the authentication service must have synchronized clocks for TOTP to function

                Push - Pushing a notification through a mobile device for authentication through something you have

        Password Authentication Protocols

            Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
                1. Client sends a username and password to a secure server
                2. Server checks and responds to client

                - PAP does not use any encryption to protect data in transit and instead requires encryption through other means

            Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
                0. Client and server share a secret key, which was previously shared and is not to be transmitted
                1. Server sends a challenge to the client
                2. The client combines the known password with the challenge and sends that back to the server
                3. Server decrypts the combined hash received from the client and checks the password to the known password

                - Secure alternative to PAP

                Microsoft created their versions of CHAP called MS-CHAP and MS-CHAPv2 but these are insecure

        Single Sign-On and Federation

            Single-Sign-On (SSO)
                - Seek to reduce the burden of identity and access management

            Federated Identity Management
                - Individuals may have many accounts across multiple systems
                - Federated identity management allows for these accounts to share identity information
                - Shibboleth.net is a federated identity management system that allows for one account to access multiple systems

            Trust Characteristics
                - Direction (one way or two way)
                    - One way - Domain #1 trust domain #2 but domain #2 does not trust domain #1
                    - Two way - Domains #1 and #2 trust each other

                - Transitivity (transitive or nontransitive)
                    - Transitive - Trust is shared between external domains if another trusted domain trusts it
                    - Nontransitive - Domains only share information with domains they explicitly trust

        RADIUS and TACACS

            Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
                - Originally used for modem pools
                - Used to authenticate modems from around the country to a single point

                - Modern uses allow a variety of systems to rely upon the same authentication source

                    Steps to a Successful RADIUS Attempt
                        1. End User sends a request to a Wireless Access Point serving as the RADIUS client
                        2. The request is relayed to a RADIUS server, then Active Directory to check the authentication method
                        3. If the authentication passes, the Active Directory responds with an Authentication Response which goes to the End User through the other devices
                        4. If the authentication fails, the Active Directory responds in the same way with a RADIUS Access Rejected response

                *EXAM TIP* - RADIUS Client is usually an application server

                Downsides of RADIUS
                    - Uses connectionless User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
                    - Does not encrypt the entire authentication sequence

            Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS)
                - Originally used UDP like RADIUS
                - Cisco later released XTACACS
                - Current standard is TACACS+
                    - Functions similarly to RADIUS
                    - Uses connection-oriented Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
                    - Fully encrypts the authentication session

        Kerberos and LDAP

            Kerberos
                - One of the core protocols for Windows Active Directory
                - Ticket-based authentication system which allows users to authenticate to a centralized service and then use tickets to gain access to distributed services

                How It Works:
                    Contacting the Authentication Server (AS)
                        1. End user wants to access a service that uses Kerberos, often called a Kerberized service
                        2. The client sends a clear-text request to an authentication server
                        3. The server looks up the user in its user Database
                            3a. The server sends a randomly generated session key to use for future communication between the client and the ticket-granting system. This message is encrypted using the client's password
                            3b. The server also sends a ticket-granting ticket which includes information about the client and the client TGS session key. This message is encrypted by a key known only by the ticket-granting server
                        4. The client decrypts the randomly generated session key for future communications

                    Contacting the Ticket-Granting Server (TGS)
                        5. The client accesses the ticket-granting server
                            5a. The client sends a copy of the ticket-granting ticket to the ticket-granting server
                            5b. The client also sends an authenticator including the client ID and the current time. This message is encrypted with the client TGS session key
                        6. The ticket-granting server decrypts the ticket-granting ticket to retrieve the client/TGS session key
                            6a. The server uses this session key to decrypt the authenticator
                        7. The TGS then randomly generates a session key for the desired service
                        8. The TGS then sends a client/server ticket which is encrypted using the service's secret key
                            8a. The TGS also sends a copy of the client/server session key. This is encrypted with the TGS session key
                    
                    Contacting the Service (SS)
                        9. The client sends two messages to the desired service
                            9a. The client sends the service the client/service session key from the TGS
                            9b. The client sends a net authenticator encrypted with the client/server session key
                        10. The server containing the service then decrypts the authenticator and validates the client

            Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
                - Provides the means to query a centralized directory service, such as Microsoft Active Directory

                Active Directory uses both LDAP and Kerberos
                    - Kerberos provides authentication
                    - LDAP provides the ability to query information stored in the directory service
                
                Ports:
                    - Kerberos - Port 88
                    - LDAP (Unencrypted) - Port 389
                    - LDAP (Encrypted) - Port 636
            
            NT LAN Manager
                - Was widely used on Windows systems for many years
                - Uses a hash-based challenge-response protocol

                - Weak encryption
                - Vulnerable to a pass-the-hash attack
                    - Allows the use of credentials from one system to gain access to another system

        SAML

            Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
                - Allows single sign-on (SSO) within a web browser across a variety of systems

                Principal - End User
                Identity Provider - Authentication Service
                Service Provider - Service being accessed

                How It Works:
                    1. Principal sends a request to the service provider
                    2. The service provider checks for previously logged-in sessions
                        2a. If there is a previously signed-in service, the principal is granted access
                    3. The provider redirects the user to the identity provider
                    4. The principal then authenticates with the identity provider
                    5. The identity provider provides an XHTML form specified for the service provider
                    6. The user uses the XHTML to request security assertion from the service provider
                    7. The service provider then redirects the principal to the resource upon validation
                    8. The resource is requested
                    9. The resource responds and access is granted

                SAML Benefits:
                    - True SSO experience for end-users
                    - No credential access for service providers

        OAuth and OpenID Connect

            Oauth - Authorization protocol that grants access from one service to another

            OpenID Connect - Authentication Protocol that helps prove identity from one service to another

        Certificate-Based Authentication

            Certificates contain a signed copy of a public key
                - Some public keys are signed by Certificate Authorities (CA)

            Certificate Authentication Uses:
                - SSH connections
                - Smart cards (CAC/PIV)
                - Network Access (802.1x)

    Authorization

        Understanding Authorization

            Principle of least privilege - An individual should only have the minimum set of privileges necessary to carry out their job function
                - Minimized insider attack damage
                - Restricts the ability of external attackers if they were to obtain an internal account
            
            Separations of Duties - Performing any critical business function should require the involvement of two or more individuals
            
            Privilege Creep - When a user accumulates excess permissions after shifting job responsibilities one or more times

            *EXAM TIP* - Be able to identify the least privilege and separation of duties issues in a scenario

        Mandatory Authorization

            Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
                - Access control system where the operating system restricts authorization based upon labels and users are not permitted to modify those authorizations

                    *FUN FACT* - Macintosh operating systems do not support mandatory access controls

                    SELinux uses MAC

                    Example - US government access controls
                        - A Level 2 user cannot access a Level 3 document because 2 < 3
                        - A level 2 user can access a level 1 document because 2 > 1

        Discretionary Access Controls

            Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
                - Access control system where permissions may be set by the owner of files, computers, and other resources

                Example - Corporate file sharing
                    - Alice gives Bob access to read, write, and execute a file
                    - Bob wants Cheryl to only read a file, so Bob assigns Cheryl read-only access


        Access Control Lists

            Access Control List - A table of users and resources which allows users permissions to resources

        Advanced Authorization Concepts

            Implicit Deny - Any action which is not explicitly allowed must be denied (whitelist)

            Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
                - Permissions are grouped into functional roles and users are assigned to those roles (Engineer, Accounting, IT)

            Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
                - Administrators make access control decisions based on characteristics of the user, object, and environment

                Example - A user must be a manager AND
                        - That user must be the manager of the employee AND
                        - Date must be after March 15, 2021

            Location-Based Access Control (LBAC)
                - Limits access based on geographic region (VPN)
            
            Time-of-Day Restrictions
                - Limits access based on time of day
                - Prevents attacks not during regular offices

        Database Access Controls

            SQL Servers use three types of authentication
                - SQL Server Authentication - Uses local database user accounts
                - Windows Authentication - Uses underlying server user accounts (Active Directory)
                - Mixed Authentication - Uses both SQL and Windows authentication modes

    Account Management

        Understanding Account and Privilege Management

            Account Management Tasks:
                - Implementing least privilege
                    - Users should only have the least amount of required access to systems and networks

                - Implementing separation of duties
                    - Sensitive functions should require verification or other action by two or more users

                - Implementing job rotation
                    - Regularly move people between job roles to prevent fraud

                    Mandatory Vacation Policy
                    - Policy enforcing restriction of systems

                - Managing the account life cycle
                    - Creating, provisioning, modifying accounts over time, and de-provisioning
                
                - Account naming schema
                    - first initial, 7 characters of the last name, the possible number of duplicates

        Account Types

            User Account - Has standard permissions and standard monitoring

            Privileged Account - Has administrative rights and requires strong controls

            Guest Account - Tied to unique individuals and have set expiration database

            Shared Account - Reduced accountability and should not be used

            Service Account - Provides access to internal server processes

            *EXAM TIP* - All of these account types hold a single purpose, and shared accounts should not be used

        Account Policies

            Group Policy Object (GPO)
                - Applies configuration settings to users and computers

        Password Policy

            Password length requirement - Longer password == longer to crack

            Password character requirement - UPPERCASE, lowercase $PEC!@L CH@R@CTER$, and numbers

                *EXAM TIP* - Best practice is to allow complex passwords but not require them, as long as they use MFA

            Password Expiration Policy - Passwords must be changed within a time-period
                Password re-use Policy - Prevents passwords from being reused
                Password Minimum Age Policy - Password cannot be reused within a certain time

                    *EXAM TIP* - Passwords should not be forced to change

            Lockout Policy - Prevent login attempts after X failed attempts

            Deprovisioning Policy - Disable unused accounts

            Password Recovery policy - Automated password recovery system using Something you know/are/have

        Managing Roles

            Role - Group permissions to allow shared security settings

        Account Monitoring

            Inaccurate Permission - Blocks work and/or violates the least privilege policy
