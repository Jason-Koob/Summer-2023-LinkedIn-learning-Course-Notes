    Introduction

        Dive Into C++ Templates and The STL

        How To Use The Exercise Files

    Templates

        What Is A Template?

            Templates are like classes 

        Template Syntax

            Templates can perform similar actions like holding functions inside of them

        Template Specialization

            The uto declaration can be used to have one object or variable be of the same type as another which is referenced in the declaration

        Impact On Header Files

        Type Inference

        Argument Deduction

            The compiler can deduce which variable type is being used and fix itself to use the correct if not already

    STL Containers

        Vector

            Arrays are just fancy arrays

        List

        Pair and Tuple

        Array

        Deque

        Queue
        
            First in, last out array
            Adapts the underlying container

        Stack

            Last in, first out queue

        Set

            Arrays but don't allow duplicates
            Multisets do allow duplicate variables

        Maps
            
            A grouping of key:value pairs

    STL Iterators

        Accessing Iterators

            pointers to values

        Input Iterators

        Output Iterators

        Forward Iterators
    
        Bidirectional Iterators

            Iterator that can go forwards and backwards with ++ and -- operators in loops

        Random Access Iterators
